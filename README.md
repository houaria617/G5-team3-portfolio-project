## Team Retrospective Analysis

During the development of our team portfolio project, the main challenge we encountered was the inconsistency in the project structure and formatting among team members. Some teammates organized their work within individual folders, while others created single HTML files or used different folder structures. This inconsistency caused confusion and made integration difficult.

To resolve this issue, the team leader took the initiative to reformat and unify the overall project structure, ensuring that all members followed the same file organization and naming conventions. This experience highlighted the importance of communication before starting individual tasks, as many of these issues could have been avoided through early coordination and agreement on a common structure.

Another aspect of our workflow was the use of branches and pull requests. Each member worked on their own branch and then created a pull request to merge changes into the repository. Although this process worked well overall, we noticed that we were merging directly into the main branch instead of using a dedicated “develop” branch — something we only realized toward the end of the project.

In addition, code review presented a minor difficulty. Some members initially reviewed pull requests using the terminal only, without using GitHub’s web interface. Later, we understood that reviewing through the GitHub interface was more efficient, as it allowed us to view changes line by line before approving and merging them.

Overall, this collaborative experience taught us valuable lessons about consistent project structuring, clear communication, and effective use of GitHub features. It helped improve our teamwork and understanding of version control in a real development environment.
